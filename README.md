## Overview

The ElastiFlow Unified Flow Collector receives, decodes, transforms, normalizes, translates and enriches network flow records and telemetry sent from network devices and applications using IPFIX, Netflow, sFlow and AWS VPC Flow Logs. The resulting records can be sent to various platforms and services, including:

- Elasticsearch
- Elastic Cloud
- Elastic Cloud Enterprise
- OpenSearch
- AWS OpenSearch Service
- Apache Kafka
- Confluent Platform
- Redpanda
- Splunk
- Cribl Stream

## Installation

```sh
# Replace <org> and <repo> with the appropriate GitHub organization and repository
helm install netobserv \
  https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/netobserv-X.Y.Z.tgz
```

## Configuration

### License Setup

To configure an ElastiFlow license key, you can add the following to your `values.yaml`:

```yaml
license:
  createSecret: true
```

Then make sure to use helm's `set` option to configure the license key when installing the chart. For example:

```sh
helm install netobserv \
  https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/netobserv-X.Y.Z.tgz \
  --set license.licenseKey="licensekeygoeshere"
```

For additional kubernetes configuration information, please refer to the comments in the [default values file](./charts/netobserv/values.yaml).

For additional environment configurations, please refer to the [configuration reference guide](https://docs.elastiflow.com/docs/config_ref/).
